##Sparta Core Project 1
Code for the first task at Sparta created using HTML JavaScript and CSS.
##Purpose
Build a browser based game using html, css and JavaScript.

The choice of game was determined via research into existing HTML browser games. Endless scrollers are common and fairly simple to setup with the use of an animated background.

The game had to include:

An instruction section explaining how to play the game.
Ether display a message when the user has won or display the users score after the game has finished.
Be styled to perfection.
Be hosted online.
