##Sparta Core Project 1
Code for the first task at Sparta created using HTML JavaScript and CSS.
##Purpose
Build a browser based game using html, css and JavaScript.

The choice of game was determined via research into existing HTML browser games. Endless scrollers are common and fairly simple to setup with the use of an animated background.

The game had to include:

An instruction section explaining how to play the game.
Ether display a message when the user has won or display the users score after the game has finished.
Be styled to perfection.
Be hosted online.
##Functionality
The functionality has been implemented using the following features:

* Javascript/JQuery
* HTML5
* CSS
* Art/sound assets sourced from OpenGameArt.org

##Project Breakdown
The project was originally split into a step-by-step to-do list that would ensure the fundamentals of the game were completed within the timeframe. This list was as follows:

1. Create the basic webpage layout.
2. Achieve a moveable player character using arrow keys/WASD.
3. Create obstacles/enemies to fall from the top of the game area.
4. Duplicate step 3 for metoers.
5. Create a shooting mechanic using collisions.
6. Apply numerical factors such as fire rate cap, health of the player, and score.
7. Enable game-ending mechanics such as lives reaching 0.
8. Apply CSS to style the game, making it more appealing.
9. Any remaining time can be used to tweak and tinker with existing mechanics to fine-tune them.
10. Optionally have others play the game for testing purposes and take feedback onboard.
